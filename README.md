# Interplay of Sex and NAFLD in Microbial Signatures: A Machine Learning Perspective

This repository supports our manuscript submitted to *Academia Nutrition and Dietetics*. We investigated gut microbiome patterns in relation to sex and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using a machine learning approach. The repository includes:

- Preprocessing scripts to convert MSP-level abundances to phylum level
- Scripts for binary classification tasks (disease and sex)
- SHAP analysis to interpret microbial drivers

## üîó Data Access

Due to file size limitations, only the custom MSP-to-phylum mapping file (`mspmap.xlsx`) is included in this repository.

Please manually download the following files from the [Human Gut Microbiome Atlas](https://www.microbiomeatlas.org):

- `vect_atlas.csv` ‚Äî Abundance matrix (MSPs as rows, samples as columns)
- `sampleID.csv` ‚Äî Sample metadata including `sample.ID`, `Gender`, and `Disease`

After downloading, place them in the root directory of this repository before running any scripts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 1: Preprocessing ‚Äî Aggregate MSPs to Phyla

```bash
python 01_msp_to_phylum_aggregation.py
*From output, manually remove the non phylum categories. They come under unclassified and unclassified eukaryota in Human Gut Microbiome Atlas. 
---

```markdown
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Groupwise Data Extraction

```bash
python 02_groupwise_split.py
```

* This uses `sampleID.csv` and the output from Step 1
* Generates `phylum_abundance_by_group.xlsx`, which contains separate sheets for:

  * `Healthy_male`
  * `Healthy_female`
  * `NAFLD_male`
  * `NAFLD_female`

These files are used for group-specific classification tasks.

---

## ü§ñ Step 3: Model Comparison

```bash
python model_comparison.py
```

* Runs classification tasks on three scenarios:

  1. NAFLD vs. Healthy
  2. Male vs. Female in Healthy group
  3. Male vs. Female in NAFLD group

* Compares four models:

  * XGBoost
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
  * Extra Trees

* Outputs performance metrics (precision, recall, F1, AUC)

* Saves comparative bar plots of model performance (F1 Score)

---

## üß† Step 4: Final Model and SHAP Interpretation

```bash
python finalmodel.py
```

* Uses best-performing model per classification task
* Computes SHAP values to identify most influential microbial phyla for disease classification 
* Generates:

  * SHAP summary plots for disease classification 
  * Final classification performance metrics
